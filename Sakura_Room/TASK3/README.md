# TASK 3 : RECONNAISSANCE

So we need to scrape the internet for any trace of this `username : SakuraSnowAngelAiko`. There is an amazing tool for just this its called [SHERLOCK](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock), i would highly recommend this.

clone the repo and run it on the username, we willget the following results.

The first 2 links were pointless but the github link contained some interesing repos.

After going through the low frequency repos (mainly because this is an easy CTF), these 3 repos caught my eye.

### What is the full email address used by the attacker?

We are given a pgp public key in the PGP repo, this is huge because when u think about PGP the first thing that should come to mind in email encryption.

After a bit of searching, for how to get data from a pgp public key I found this -> [PGP-resource](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/linux-security-cookbook/0596003919/ch07s26.html)

```console
foo@bas:~$ gpg --import key
```

And there, we go we just found the emailID üëç.

### What is the attacker's full real name?
