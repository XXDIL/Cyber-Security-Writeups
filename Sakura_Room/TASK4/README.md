# TASK 4 : UNVEIL

I mean its fairly obvious that the the repo named ETH will be used for this section of the task as it has to do with crypto currency(Yes BitCoin is not the only cryptocurrency)

In the ETH repo of the same github site we have the following file content: 
`stratum://ethwallet.workerid:password@miningpool:port`

------

### 1) What cryptocurrency does the attacker own a cryptocurrency wallet for?

Just look up ETH cryptocurrency, this should do the job.


### 2) What is the attacker's cryptocurrency wallet address?

First I searched sample cryptocurrency wallet address, it looks like this `3FZbgi29cpjq2GjdwV8eyHuJJnkLtktZc5`.

But the file doesnt comtain anything usefull but i wasted to check the activity on the repo so I go to `Insights -> Network` here i see that there was a commit made before the current one.

after clicking on the previous commit i see the following, BINGO!

that looks a lot like what we need ðŸ˜‰.


### 3) What mining pool did the attacker receive payments from on January 23, 2021 UTC?

there is even a site link in the git commit. `eu1.ethermine.org` but this doesnt work for me so i tried `ethermine.org` this opened a site where i saw this.

Imma be honest i didn't know what a Mining Pool was, after seeing this image I was able to answer the question.


### 4) What other cryptocurrency did the attacker exchange with using their cryptocurrency wallet?

For this i searched the [top 10 Crypto Currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/) and basically brute forced it ðŸ˜…. Give it a try.
