In this room the main things to look out for are **minor details**. There have been many times when the answer is looking me in the eye and I just look over it. Thats the most frustrating thing imo. So save yourself some time and look deeply into evrything. 

Having Said all that this is a very comprehensive writeup of the room, primarily because I feel like most writeups dont give the searching process of these OSINT challenges, I get thats the point of an OSINT challenge. But if the person is a beginner, his search Querries will be completely different to that of a pro. To get a better understanding of what to search what not to search is also extremely important.
