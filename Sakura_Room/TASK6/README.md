# TASK 6 : HOMEBOUND

### 1) What airport is closest to the location the attacker shared a photo from prior to getting on their flight?

If you look closely at the background of the image you can see a structure that looks similar to the `Washington Monument`. Which is situated at... WASHINGTON!

There are 3 main airport codes for Washington:
- IAD
- BWI
- ?

### 2) What airport did the attacker have their last layover in?

So here I searched for [JAL layoff sakura lounge](https://www.jal.co.jp/en/inter/service/lounge/). Turns out the main one is in `Heneda Airport`. You can find the Airport code your self üëç.

### 3) What lake can be seen in the map shared by the attacker as they were on their final flight home?

I would recommend using Google Maps for this task.

Now what all do we know:
- She started her journey from Washington DC
- Then a layoff at Heneda, Japan

So she is in japan, now we need to find a place that looks like the one in the tweet near Heneda.

We found a match! just zoom in more and the name should come up.


### 4) What city does the attacker likely consider "home"?

Use the URL we got in TASK 5 Q2 on TOR to get the following:

Just Querry the BSSID of `HomeWifi` in wigle.net -> advanced search -> Wifi/Cell Details and that should open up a map.

After this you will get an expandable map option just keep scrolling out till you start seeing some useful names and the ones that sound like they could be city names. üëçüëç
