# Life Online - Challenge 2 (growingup)

## Failed Attempt:

When I was first going through the tweets, I fell into the trap of the stations.

I started looking up the train routes from `Maesteg` to `Ebbw Vale`. And stumbled upon `Cardiff`.

![Cardiff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66634743/115953830-cb09d600-a4fe-11eb-8cc4-d92f06d23b5a.png)

Even in this picture of the station, its written Cardiff. But ofcourse there was no luck. ðŸ˜§


## Success:

Then I reached the top of the profile where his bio was present. and I recalled seeing those 3 forward slashes : `///`.

Bingo ðŸ˜Ž!

So I visited `https://what3words.com` and searched for `///push.asking.barn`:

![Yorks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66634743/115954023-b67a0d80-a4ff-11eb-8b07-4116c0db421a.png)

As we can see it suggests `Yorks`

### `ANSEWER : Yorks`
