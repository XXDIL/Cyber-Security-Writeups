To check for time zones i prefer this site : [timeanddate](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/#!cities=298). I pinned cardiff on the map `A`.

- I have a `GMT+4` time zone and UK is at `GMT+0`. 
- Therefore there is a difference of 4 hours, ie the tweet was made at `2:02 AM GMT+4` -> `10:02 PM GMT+0`
- So his work ends at 10:02 PM and his work lasted for 8 hours(from his tweet)
- This gives us a starting time of : 2:02 PM (UK time)


I tried inputting `2:02 PM` but it didn't accept it so i tried military time : `14:02` and boom ðŸ˜Ž its was accepted.

### `ANSWER : 14:02`
