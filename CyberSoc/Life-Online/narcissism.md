# Life Online - Challenge 6 (narcissism)

Again we need to workout who is **George**??

Found him.ðŸ™‚

Looking into his profile (the usual scroll to the bottom and work your way up). Look at all his tweets etc. Then I found this.

Looks like he is soo confident that he tweeted his encrypted password on the internet.ðŸ˜†

At first i was looking too deep into it, trying to findout the hash type used:

I tried both these hashtypes:
```console
foo@bar:~$ hashcat -a0 -m2400 'aW1hbWF6aW5nMTIz' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
foo@bar:~$ hashcat -a0 -m2410 'aW1hbWF6aW5nMTIz' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```
But no luck, then I went back to the basics(I was giving George too much credit) I tried `ceasar`, `base32` and then finally `base64`.
