# Life Online - Challenge 8 (bluengreen)

Now if you look at the question, there isn't much to work with ie. no hints(or so it would seem)

![question](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66634743/115958238-a79f5500-a517-11eb-863d-7a3ddc4dd144.png)

The biggest hint is in the title of the question `bluengreen` -> `blue and green`.

If you look at the header photo you can see the eyes match the colors blue and green. So clicking on the header pic we can see a message.
