# Evidence Investigation - Challenge 3 (chemtrails)

There is a lot of information on that boarding pass, but all the important ones are blacked out.

- I looked into seat maps of British Airways for first calss
- musicairport.com (waste of time)
- IATA details

But it hit me, when we board an aircraft the flight attendants scan our boarding passes and the barcode wasn't blured ðŸ˜ƒ. So I looked up [online barcode scanner](https://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com/).

We get the seat number.

### `ANSWER : 22B`
