# Evidence Investigation - Challenge 12 (undercover)

Initially the file looks empty but obviously there is something important in the file somewhere, but where?

Ahh ... the oldest trick in the book (not really)

So I dont know about you all but when we got an assignment that was required to be an insane amount of words long, we used to `fill it up with text but in white text color` so it would show up as those many words long but would not be visible.

so if you just hit `Ctrl + A` it will highlight all the text in the doc, BINGO!
