# Evidence Investigation - Challenge 14 (photophile)

All images have a signature or like some background information on the image. This is called `Exif Data` (look into it a bit)

If you are new to CTF's there is a tool called [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/install.html) that is used to extract ... well ... Exif Data.

Here is a sample run of that :



notice the camera model already mentioned. Yay!
