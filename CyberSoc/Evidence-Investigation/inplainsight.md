# Evidence Investigation - Challenge 7 (inplainsight)

I would highly recommend to look into Steganography, it's an amazing field all together. If you are interested visit this site : [0xrick](https://0xrick.github.io/lists/stego/). Its the best resource for steg (IMO).

Getting back to our challenge, as we are already given the steganographic tool used : [mystegosaurus.co.uk](https://mystegosaurus.co.uk/). We simply use it to `DOCODE` the image.

Give it a try on your own(Its really easy). You will recieve a text file just read the contents.
