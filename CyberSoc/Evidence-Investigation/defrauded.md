# Evidence Investigation - Challenge 13 (defrauded)

This is a little tricky only because the question is too long. 

Basically we are given the original document, which the suspect tried to change. So if we can find out the date it was latest modified we would get the original date the invoice was created. 

To findout the last modified date we can use our trusty `exiftool` as mentioned in the previous challenges.
