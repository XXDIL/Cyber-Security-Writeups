# Evidence Investigation - Challenge 5 (balancethebooks)

In the PDF we have the following important things:

- Company Name
- Company Number
- Confirmation Date

We need a way to uniquely identify the company, so I searched for : `Company number 01867162`. lead me to [Companies House](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/01867162).

Then I navigate to the Filing History tab of the site:

The `Confirmation date` is really important as this is the field we will use to find the right document.

If we see the circled links on `14 Dec 2020` are what we need. SO lets open the file. After a bit of reading it was clear that the money related  things would be 
in the `Balance Sheet` section. I have circled the important things.

As the question asks about the `CASH` the company has so we just look at the cash aspect of the balance sheet.

### `ANSWER : 102.347`
