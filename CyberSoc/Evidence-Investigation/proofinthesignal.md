# Evidence Investigation - Challenge 11 (proofinthesignal)

This challenge becomes easier if you know 
- what is [SSID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)#SSID)
- what is [BSSID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)#:~:text=The%20BSSID%20is%20a%2048,basic%20service%20area%20(BSA).)
- what is [wigle.net](https://wigle.net/)

After that is done you need to know how to use wigle.net properly and effectively.

I tend to use Advanced Search as this is through:

See those 2 dots with jammy written on them that is the wifi port where he was detected.
