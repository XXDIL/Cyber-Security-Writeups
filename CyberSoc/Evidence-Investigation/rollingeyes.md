# Evidence Investigation - Challenge 10 (rollingeyes)

For this challenge I started by searching for `Poppy-n-Pals Pet care service Whales` (as mentioned in the question). I was able to find th exact image on Google maps too (using satalite mode).

I was ready to search the red outlined roads (as they were the only roads that were accessable through google street view). I also know that you can switch between different `years` while in street view but as the challenge took place in 2020 so I kept the year around that.

I started my search from the bottom left corner and mover in an anti clockwise direction (call it luck I guess). Within a few meters i see this :

This person matches every description 
- In the area (obvious)
- getting out of a car
- wearing a hoodie

So everything checks out üëç.

### `ANSWER : red blue`
